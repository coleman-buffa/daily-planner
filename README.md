# Daily Planner

This daily planner project represents an exercise in using JQuery to create a simple daily planner. The planner displays the current date and a list of time blocks that can have text assigned to them. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. By clicking on a time block the user can type in text which is then saved to local storage using the save button located on the right hand side of each time block. This allows the contents of each text box to be saved in the event the page is refreshed or the browser is closed. See the Goals and Methods section below for implementation details and project action shots.
